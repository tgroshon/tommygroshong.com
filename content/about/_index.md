*Probably* an expert in creating efficiency improvements through building software applications,
migration and optimization of cloud infrastructure, and business strategy consulting for managers
and employees.

Over my career, I have been lucky enough to work at some great organizations and with some amazing
people. Each place I worked and person I worked with taught me something.

I hope the content you find here is an aid to you on your journey in software and tech.
