 "Violence between local people's will be the norm" ... the opposite will be
 true, especially in a truly free society where any/everyone can be armed and
 protect themselves. The gun is the greatest equalizer of force in history; a
 peasant with a few weeks of training and practice is capable of defeating
 bigger, stronger, better trained, lifetime soldiers (there is still a
 non-trivial training disparity, but nothing like the disparity in pre-gun
 combat).  Now today, every time you have conflict with your neighbor, do they
 threaten to kill/hurt/force you?  How often do you bring the police into a
 neighbor relationship (even a neighbor you don't like)?  I'm going to guess (a)
 threats of harm between you are rare, (b) the police are rarely involved, and
 (c) the threat of the police is far down the list of reasons why you don't just
 murder your neighbor. The point is, most people want non-violent resolution to
 their conflicts.  I believe this is true.  The problem then becomes dealing
 with the "predators" who want to "assert themselves" as you put it, or rather
 "use coercive force to their advantage".  So, without police/government, how
 can this be done?  First question, has the existence of police/government ended
 the operation of predators?  Absolutely not.  So the police don't even
 accomplish the role they ostensibly exist for: preventing violence and crime.
 In the case of violent crime, the vast vast vast majority of police effort is
 _after_ crimes have been committed.    Police have always been very bad at
 proactively stopping crime in progress.  What is the most consistently
 effective protection to you against violent crime?  Being armed with a gun
 (esp. concealed carry).  But what are police really good at?  Enforcing
 governmental mandates to proactively disarm citizens.  Police forces have an
 incentive for crime to exist, and for you to be helpless to protect yourself.
 Ignorant pseudo-economists claim "police are a monopoly on violence and
 monopolies reduce supply and drive up costs so that's good to apply to violent
 force". This is false.  The accurate claim is that "police are a monopoly on
 self-defense; reducing the supply and driving up the cost".  Police don't
 monopolize violence, they monopolize self-defense violence; it is now more rare
 and more costly.  Costly how?  In the sense of costliness of (a) acquiring
 highly-regulated arms, (b) defending yourself against active violence, (c)
 defending yourself against legal action of the state to prove you acted in
 self-defense, and (d) cost of police action against you if they don't like the
 arms you use or how you use them.
