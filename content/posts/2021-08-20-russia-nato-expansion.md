A little story I want to tell about the Russian Federation and the expansion of
NATO under the direction of the US Government.

NOTE: Conversational quotes are paraphases of actual statements.

**1991**:

the Soviet Union dissolution was largely complete. All the former members of the
Union were now their own nation states and several of the more radically
evolving nations (like Poland) were already being approached by NATO and Europe
(who was in proto-EU stages) for membership in their treaties.

**1992**:

Bill Clinton is elected President of the US, and Boris Yeltsin is elected
President of Russia.

**1993**:

Yeltsin and the Russian Duma (Congress) were super worried about NATO expanding
into former Soviet territories (especially Poland, Hungary, Ukraine, and
Czechslovakia) and basically just drawing a new Cold War line right up to the
Russian border and beginning neo-isolation on Russia in their weakened state.
Literally the entire Duma joined the "Anti-NATO Expansion" caucus. Yeltsin told
Clinton and Diplomats "stop expanding NATO and Europe Treaties like this, it
looks like you're going to screw us; instead let's get all of us former Soviet
countries into the treaties together".

The US proposes to make a new program, "Partnership for Peace", within NATO that
former Soviet nations can join without becoming full members.

> U.S. officials led Russian President Boris Yeltsin to believe in 1993 that the
> Partnership for Peace was the alternative to NATO expansion, rather than a
> precursor to it, while simultaneously planning for expansion after Yeltsin’s
> re-election bid in 1996 and telling the Russians repeatedly that the future
> European security system would include, not exclude, Russia.

>   Heard"](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/russia-programs/2018-03-16/nato-expansion-what-yeltsin-heard)
>   declassified meeting documents between US officials and President Yeltsin

**1994**:

NATO officially launches the "Partnership for Peace" program in January 1994.
The following countries join the program:

1. Ukraine      (February 8, 1994)
1. Moldova      (March 16, 1994)
1. Georgia      (March 23, 1994)
1. Azerbaijan   (May 4, 1994)
1. Turkmenistan (May 10, 1994)
1. Kazakhstan   (May 27, 1994)
1. Kyrgyzstan   (June 1, 1994)
1. **Russia**   (June 22, 1994)
1. Uzbekistan   (July 13, 1994)
1. Armenia      (October 5, 1994)

Clinton goes to Prague and meets with the leaders of the Czech Republic, Poland,
Hungary, and Slovakia saying they're on a “track that will lead to NATO
membership” and that “does not draw another line dividing Europe a few hundred
miles to the east.” Clinton and the US says nothing to Russia.

Yeltsin gets pissed, gets a ton of shit from the Duma, and responds something
like "you said you weren't expanding NATO, but you're promising all these
countries membership". To which the US responds something like, "well of course
we're expanding, that was always the plan and there's nothing you can do about
it."

When Yeltsin complains further that US agreed not to do what they're doing, the
US Ambassadors literally say "Boris was drunk during our meetings and must have
misunderstood" (Boris Yeltsin had a well known drinking problem). Clinton again
agrees not to do anything else until after 1996 elections (US and Russia have
the same presidential cycle).

**1995**:

The U.S. House of Representatives adopts the "National Security Revitalisation
Act" providing for the expansion of NATO to include the following nations:

1. Czech Republic
2. Poland
3. Slovakia
4. Hungary

**1996**:

President Bill Clinton in a speech in Detroit presents a specific NATO
enlargement timeline saying that the first new member states from Central and
Eastern Europe should be admitted to NATO before 1999.

**1997**:

In the Madrid conference, NATO officially and publicly invites the following
countries to join as full members:

1. Poland
2. Hungary
3. Czechoslovakia

Russia is pissed; Yeltsin looks like a tool. NATO now has roughly the same
Eastern borders that Nazi Germany had before invading the Soviet Union in 1941.

**1998**:

The Kosovo War in Serbia begins; lots of ethnic cleansing and other war
crimes; super nasty stuff.

For background, Serbia has been a pseudo-protectorate of Russia for literally
centuries with Russians and Serbians sharing many ethnic and cultural ties.
Remember, *World War I* was primarily kicked off when (a) the Austro-Hungarian
Empire invaded Serbia in response to Serbian assassination of the Austrian
Archduke and (b) Russia sent the army to defend Serbia. Allied nations on both
sides got involved and WHAMMY ... The War to End All Wars (or maybe not).

**1999**:

In March, NATO starts launching airstrikes in Serbia and deploying peace keeping
forces. All without talking to Russia. Like at all. To put in perspective,
imagine Russia unilaterally bombing Guatemala or Panama without even mentioning
it to the US. The Duma is once again pissed off, and Yeltsin looks like an even
bigger tool.

Soon after, President Boris Yeltsin resigns in disgrace as President of Russia.
In Russia, many still consider Yeltsin a *puppet of the west*.

Now, who did Yeltsin pick as his successor? ... **Vladimir Putin**.

**2004**:

New bloc, consisting primarily of former Soviet nations, join NATO as full members:

1. Bulgaria
1. Estonia
1. Latvia
1. Lithuania
1. Romania
1. Slovakia
1. Slovenia

Estonia and Latvia border the Russian mainland. Lithuania borders the Russian administered area Kaliningrad.

**2007**:

with Russian-backed President Yanukovych fleeing the country and the Ukrainian
Parliament voting to form a new interim unity government, backed by the European

February-March: Russia invades Eastern Ukraine and occupies and annexes the
Crimean Peninsula and the port city of Sevastopol, which has been the major base
for Russia's Black Sea Fleet since the 18th Century while the region has an
ethnic Russian majority and speaks Russian as its most common language.

September: NATO conducts a summit in Wales and names five countries as eligible
for enhanced opportunities partnership for dialogue and cooperation (EOP):

1. Australia (North Atlantic what? lol)
2. Finland
3. Georgia
4. Jordan
5. Sweden

**2016**:

Ukraine passes legislation opening the possibility of joining of NATO.

**2018**:

Three countries are upgraded to "aspiring members" of NATO:

1. Bosnia and Herzegovina
2. Georgia
3. Ukraine

> Currently, three partner countries have declared their aspirations to NATO
> membership: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia and Ukraine.

## The Big Question

Why has Vladimir Putin not embraced relations with the west?
