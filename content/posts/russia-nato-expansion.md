A little story I want to tell about Russian Federation and the expansion of NATO
under the direction of the US Government.

**1991**: the Soviet Union dissolution was largely complete. All the former members
of the Union were now their own nation states and several of the more radically
evolving nations (like Poland) were already being approached by NATO and Europe
(who was in proto-EU stages) for membership in their treaties.

**1992**: Bill Clinton is elected President of the US, and Boris Yeltsin is
elected President of Russia.

**1993**: Yeltsin and the Russian Duma (Congress) were super worried about NATO
expanding into former Soviet territories (especially Poland, Hungary, Ukraine,
and Czechslovakia) and basically just drawing a new Cold War line right up to
the Russian border and beginning neo-isolation on Russia in their weakened
state. Literally the entire Duma joined the "Anti-NATO Expansion" caucus.
Yeltsin told Clinton and Diplomats "stop expanding NATO and Europe Treaties like
this, it looks like you're going to screw us; instead let's get all of us former
Soviet countries into the treaties together". So US said "let's make a new org,
'Partnership for Peace', within NATO that everyone can join without becoming
full members'.

**1994**: Clinton goes to Prague and meets with the leaders of the Czech
Republic, Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia saying they're on a “track that will
lead to NATO membership” and that “does not draw another line dividing Europe a
few hundred miles to the east.” They don't say anything to Russia. Yeltsin gets
pissed, gets a ton of shit from the Duma, and says to US "you said you weren't
expanding NATO, but you're promising all these countries membership". To which
the US says, "well of course we're expanding, that was always the plan and
there's nothing you can do about it." When Yeltsin complains that US agreed not
to do that, the ambassadors literally say "Boris was drunk during our meetings
and must have misunderstood" (Boris Yeltsin had a well known drinking problem).
Clinton again agrees not to do anything else until after 1996 elections (US and
Russia have the same presidential cycle).

**1995**: The U.S. House of Representatives adopted the National Security
Revitalisation Act providing for the extension of NATO to include the Czech
Republic, Poland, Slovakia and Hungary.

**1996**: President Bill Clinton in a speech in Detroit presents a specific
NATO enlargement timeline saying that the first new member states from Central
and Eastern Europe should be admitted to NATO before 1999.

**1997**: In the Madrid conference, NATO officially invites Poland, Hungary, and
Czechoslovakia to join as full members. Russia is pissed; Yeltsin looks like a
weak fool. NATO now has the same Eastern borders that Nazi Germany had before
the 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union.

**1998**: The Kosovo War in Serbia begins; lots of ethnic cleansing and other war
crimes; super nasty stuff.

Now, Serbia has been a pseudo-protectorate of Russia for a long time. Russians
and Serbians have ethnic and cultural ties going back centuries. Remember, *World
War I* largely started because Austro-Hungarians invaded Serbia (after some serbs
killed the Austrian Archduke) and Russia sent the army to defend Serbia. Allies
on both sides got involved and WHAMMY ... The War to End All Wars (or maybe not).

**March 1999**: NATO starts launching airstrikes in Serbia and deploying peace
keeping forces. All without talking to Russia. Like at all. To put in
perspective, imagine Russia unilaterally attacking Guatemala or Panama. The Duma
is once again pissed off, Yeltsin looks like a bigger tool, and soon after he
resigns in disgrace. In Russia, many still consider Yeltsin a *puppet of the
west*.

Now who did Yeltsin pick as his successor? ... **Vladimir Putin**.

**2007**:

**2014**: Revolution in Ukraine, followed by NATO acceptance of Ukraine as an
aspirant NATO member.

**May 2020**:

> Currently, three partner countries have declared their aspirations to NATO
> membership: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia and Ukraine.

If you aren't familiar with the geography of that part of the world, it looks like this:

Ukraine and Georgia are those countries on the southern borders of Russia.

**Today**: Why has Vladimir Putin not embraced relations with the US/EU?
