Over the last few weeks, I've been reading _[The Anarchist
Handbook](http://anarchisthandbook.com)_ by Michael Malice and I strongly
recommend it. The book is a collection of anarchist and libertarian writings,
modern and historical, discussing the ideas of free and decentralized society.

In an online convo, I interacted with someone who gave a good summary of many
other people's questions and concerns about anarchic free and decentralized
society (free society for short):

> "Even in anarchic societies, humans will still be human. There are likely to be
> organisations developed that are not morally good and aim to oppress people or
> populations. And there will be innocent populations that are morally good who
> cannot protect themselves. I suppose my question is: anarchism is not likely to
> by definition eliminate tyranny/authoritarianism. How can tyranny be defeated in
> a general sense in an anarchic society? In a separate sense, the first country
> to vote to dissolve their government is unlikely to fare well."

Start any conversation about anarchism, and some variation of this is guaranteed
to come up: either maliciously or sincerely. I consider the person who made that
specific statement to be earnest and sincere.

I highly recommend reading _The Anarchist Handbook_, especially chapters
18-22 (the last five chapters) which talk _A LOT_ about these kinds of more
practical questions. For those who can't invest that time right now, I
will condense some ideas here.

Critiques of anarchism are inevitably critiques of the status quo. That is the
theme of this post. What does it mean? All the things you're worried about in an
anarchist society are already problems in your current system. You may not
recognize them--maybe you're too accustomed to them--but they're there.

Anarchism and the free society aren't about magically solving all social
problems into a hunky-dory utopia.

The statement can be broken down into the following elements:

1. Those who aspire to be tyrants will always exist.
1. Immoral organizations will form to oppress people.
1. Innocent people are not able to protect themselves.
1. Other nation-states will try to take advantage of decentralized societies.

## Notes

- Non-state organizations can’t use and rely on force and coercion the same way
  that the State can/will. Why? Because governmental entities can claim immunity
  from legal action (e.g. qualified immunity and sovereign immunity). Non-state
  orgs, even very large and powerful, are just as liable as any individual.

- All the things you’re worried in an Anarchist society are still problems in
  our current system. There are today innocent populations who can’t protect
  themselves against oppression: they are disarmed by the State (police) and
  then oppressed by whoever wills, usually criminals and the State (police).

- An FDDDDkkkkkk doesn’t
  claim to be a utopia. That doesn’t mean it doesn’t prioritize safety and
  non-violence, it very much does, but rather that it doesn’t pretend that
  everything will be magically hunky-dory under the system unlike both Communism
  and Democratic Republicanism. Rather, a free society says that conflict can be
  handled better without the State.

- You can’t “defeat Tyranny in a general sense”. Free society solution is to
  limit tyrant’s growth paths, complicate their reward functions, and distribute
  resistance capabilities more broadly.
